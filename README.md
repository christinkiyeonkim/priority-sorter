## Background & Motivation 🧠

I'm currently learning about lists and sorting in Python—things like sorting alphabetically, by numbers, and naturally I got curious about sorting by dates too. That’s how this little project started. 

Honestly, it’s super simple and just something I made to try applying what I've been learning. Instead of trying to build something fancy or useful for others, I wanted to see what I could actually make and use myself, with the basics I know so far.
